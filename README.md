## Main Lessons Learned about Clean Code
- **Consistent Naming Conventions**: Consistently naming variables, functions, and classes according to a clear and understandable convention improves code readability and maintainability.
- **Modularization**: Breaking down code into smaller, modular components with well-defined responsibilities makes it easier to understand, test, and maintain.
- **Documentation and Comments**: Providing clear and concise documentation and comments throughout the codebase helps other developers understand the purpose and functionality of each component.
